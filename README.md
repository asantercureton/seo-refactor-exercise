## Usage
Replaced one <strong>div</strong> with <strong>nav</strong> to provide more semantic value and allow other develops to quickly identify where the navigation pane was within the code. Also applied appropiate semantic tags to replace the other <strong>div</strong> tags within the html code - reference 1st screenshot below.
